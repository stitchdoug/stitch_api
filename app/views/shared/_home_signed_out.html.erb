  <h1>Welcome to the Stitch API</h1>

  <p>
    This API allows you to remotely create and display Stitches. Once a remote request has been made, it's
    entered into the queue and a Stitch is returned shortly thereafter. Prior to completion, a placeholder
    graphic or embedded player should be displayed. Content On Demand!
